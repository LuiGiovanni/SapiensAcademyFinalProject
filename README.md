5 small real world examples of OOp design patterns

Design Patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented
software developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that
software developers faced during software development. These solutions were
obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial
period.
It’s important to understand that design patterns were never meant to be hacked
together shortcuts to be applied in a haphazard, “one-size-fits-all” manner to your
code. There is ultimately no substitute for genuine problem-solving ability in software
engineering
